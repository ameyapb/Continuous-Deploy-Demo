Step 3: Define Pipeline and Stages 

a. initiate 
b. build stage
c. test stage
d. deploy 


Add the Initiate Stage :- This stage is responsible for initiating the pipeline as soon as there is a Git push and commit.

Add the Build Stage :- This stage executes the build.yml file to install all the project dependencies.

Add the Test Stage :- This stage runs the test.yml file to perform static testing on the project.

Add the Deploy Stage :- This stage triggers the Ansible playbook to deploy the application on an EC2 instance

Step 4 : Save and Configure Jenkins Pipeline

Save the Jenkinsfile in your project's repository.
In the Jenkins project configuration, select "Pipeline script from SCM" as the Definition.
Specify the repository URL where you saved the Jenkinsfile.
Optionally, set up credentials if your repository requires authentication.
Save the pipeline configuration.

Build stage specifications : 
Identify the requirements and dependencies of your project.
Determine the build process necessary to compile, package, or prepare your project for deployment.
Consider any specific tools, compilers, or scripts required for the build.

Test stage specifications : 
Create a new file named test.yml (or any name of your choice) in the root directory of your project.
Open the test.yml file in a text editor.
Specify the configuration details for each step/task in the testing process.
Include commands, arguments, or scripts necessary to execute the tests using the chosen testing frameworks or tools.
